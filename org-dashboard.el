;;; Commentary:

;; Org Dashboard provides a visual summary of progress on projects and
;; tasks.
;;
;; For example, if an org file (known by `org-agenda-files') contains
;; the following:
;;
;;     * Project: Better Health
;;     :PROPERTIES:
;;     :CATEGORY: health
;;     :END:
;;
;;     ** Milestones
;;     *** [66%] run 10 km/week
;;     **** TODO learn proper warmup
;;     **** DONE look for a jogging partner
;;     **** DONE run 10 minutes on monday
;;     
;;     * Project: Super Widget
;;     :PROPERTIES:
;;     :CATEGORY: widget
;;     :END:
;;
;;     ** Milestones
;;     *** [1/6] release 0.1
;;     **** DONE git import
;;     **** TODO create github project
;;     **** TODO add readme
;;     **** TODO publish
;;
;; Then `M-x org-dashboard-display' generates the following report and
;; displays it in a new buffer:
;;
;;     health                run 10 km/week [██████████████████████           ]  66%
;;     widget                   0.1 release [██████                           ]  18%
;;
;; A dynamic block form is also supported. Writing the following in an
;; org file and then running `org-dblock-update', or placing the
;; cursor on the first line of the block and then typing `C-c C-c',
;; will insert the same report shown above into the block:
;;
;;     #+BEGIN: block-dashboard
;;     #+END:

;; Notes:
;;
;; Labels link back to the trees where they were found.
;;
;; The color of the progress bar is (naively, for now) chosen based on
;; the progress value, from dark red to bright green.
;;
;; The first column displays categories. You can turn this off by
;; customizing the `org-dashboard-display-category' option. Note that,
;; if not set per-tree through a property or per-file through a
;; keyword, the category defaults to the file name without extension.

;;
;; This module was inspired by Zach Peter's [A Dashboard for your
;; Life](http://thehelpfulhacker.net/2014/07/19/a-dashboard-for-your-life-a-minimal-goal-tracker-using-org-mode-go-and-git/).
